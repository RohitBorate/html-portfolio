<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As an Analyst Ethical Hacker at CyberXchange, I conduct comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) for various platforms, including web applications, Android systems, and network infrastructure. I leverage my expertise in VAPT methodologies and tools, such as Burp Suite and Nessus, to identify and report security vulnerabilities and provide effective solutions.</p>

<p>I also facilitate communication and knowledge sharing with IT professionals and management, aligning security measures with organizational goals. Additionally, I mentor and guide freshers in their journey to becoming proficient cyber security professionals, equipping them with essential skills and techniques.</p>

<p>My passion for cyber security stems from my educational background in Computer Engineering, which I completed from MIT World Peace University in June 2022. During the pandemic, I realized the importance of learning and mastering VAPT and obtained multiple certifications from IBM in Cybersecurity Tools, Processes, and Compliance. </p>

<p>I am driven by the challenge of securing digital ecosystems and mitigating potential risks, and I am always eager to learn and stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in the field. I possess excellent problem-solving skills, a meticulous attention to detail, and the ability to effectively communicate technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.</p>
